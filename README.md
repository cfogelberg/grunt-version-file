> Writes code provenance information to a JSON file for deployment alongside the application

Knowing exactly which version of the application has been deployed is crucial for debugging, but it is difficult without careful record keeping. One solution to this problem is to automatically generate a file with code provenance information that is deployed alongside the application. This plugin does that.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.4`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-version-file --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-version-file');
```

## The "version_file" task

### Overview and Usage
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `version_file` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    version_file: {
      make: {
        options: {
          out: ["some/file/path.json"],
          generator_list: ["foo", "bar"],
          generator_dir: "some_directory_in_grunt_version_file"
        }
      }
    }
});
```

### Options

#### options.out
Type: `String`
Purpose: Output file path to write to
Default value: None, required

#### options.generator_list
Type: `Array` of ``String`
Purpose: Specify the list of version file value generators to use
Default value: ["datestring", "npm_version"]

#### options.generator_dir
Type: `String`
Purpose: Specify the path to the directory with value generator definitions
Default value: "generators"

### Generators

grunt-version-file uses a plugin architecture to generate key value-entries for code provenance. It is deployed wih several generators and you can easily create your own. Please make a pull request if you do!

A genereator plugin is made available to the grunt-version-file plugin via a javascript file which exports an object with a `label` function, a `value` function and (optionally) an `init` function. These functions must operate synchronously and must wait for any asynchronous operations to complete before returning to their caller.

The `label` function returns the JSON-valid string label for this generator's field in the version file.

The `value` function returns the (possibly build-specific) value of this generator's field in the version file.

The `init` function is executed before the value or label function are called.

A generator's name in the `generator_list` option is the filename without the .js extension. It is recommended that this is the same as the result of calling `label`, but it is not required.

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

### Adding generators

To add a generator create a new file in the `lib/generators` directory which exports an object with a `label`, `value` and optionally an `init` function. See the included generators for examples.

### Code smells

The following are bad, please feel free to fix them yourself :)

- The tests don't use mocks, they should
- The generator init functions are not executed at construction and initialisation but just before the value and label methods are called.
